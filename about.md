### Funny facts about Yann LeCun

Yann LeCun doesn't need to make hidden units. They hide by themselves when he approaches. <br/>
Deep Belief Nets actually believe deeply in Yann LeCun. <br/>
Yann LeCun discovered how the brain really works. Once a year for the last 25 years. <br/>
Markov random fields think Yann LeCun is intractable. <br/>
If you defy Yann LeCun, he will maximize your entropy in no time. Your free energy will be gone even before you reach equilibrium. <br/>
Yann LeCun can make you regret without bounds. <br/>
Yann LeCun can make your weight decay (your weight, but unfortunately not mine). <br/>
Yann LeCun doesn't need support vectors. He can support high-dimensional hyperplanes with his pinky finger. <br/>
A little-known fact about Yann LeCun: he frequents Bayesians with prior convictions (with thanks to David Schwab). <br/>
All kernels that ever dared approaching Yann LeCun woke up convolved. <br/>
Most farmhouses are surrounded by nice fields. Yann LeCun's farmhouse lies in a hyper-plain, surrounded by a mean field, and has kernels in la grange. <br/>
The only kernel Yann LeCun has ever used is a kernel of truth. <br/>
After an encounter with Yann LeCun, support vectors become unhinged and suffer optimal hyper-pain (with thanks to Andrew Jamieson). <br/>
Yann LeCun's generalizations are boundless. <br/>
Yann LeCun goes directly to third Bayes. <br/>
Never interrupt one of Yann LeCun's talks: you will suffer his wrath if you maximize the bargin'.
